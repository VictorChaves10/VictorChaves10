# Hi, I'm Victor! :D
         

### About me

I started studying programming at the beginning of 2022 and completed my first web development course, where I acquired knowledge in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. After consolidating these skills, I had the opportunity to get to know the C# language and the .NET framework. I studied object-oriented programming concepts and MVC architecture patterns.

Over a period of three months, I took part in a .NET academy, where I improved my knowledge of ASP .NET Core, routes, APIs, Angular, SQL, ORM, and other essential fundamentals. In addition, I sought to improve my skills through online courses dedicated to .NET, which gave me hands-on experience with projects and challenges.


- ðŸŽ¯ I'm currently interested in developing my skills on both the backend and frontend, with the aim of becoming a full stack developer.
