# Hi, I'm Victor! :D

### About Me

I began my programming journey in early 2022 and completed my first web development course, gaining expertise in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. After mastering these skills, I had the opportunity to explore the C# language and the .NET framework, diving into object-oriented programming concepts and MVC architecture patterns.

Over a three-month period, I participated in a .NET academy, refining my understanding of ASP .NET Core, routes, APIs, Angular, SQL, ORM, and other essential fundamentals. Additionally, I sought to enhance my skills through dedicated online courses in .NET, gaining hands-on experience with various projects and challenges.

Currently, my focus is on honing my skills in both backend and frontend development, with the goal of becoming a full stack developer. ðŸŽ¯
